# Logic-Controlled-Board
Logic-controlled board designed using Finite State Machine (FSM) principles. Implemented with 7400-series ICs and basic logic gates on a physical breadboard. Switch inputs drive state transitions that control colored LED outputs based on a predefined sequence. Simulated and verified using Quartus and Virtual Breadboard.
